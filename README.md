========

Osgi-Run - A Gradle plugin to make the development of modular applications using OSGi completely painless

## Apply the osgi-run plugin

### Gradle 2.1+

```groovy
plugins {
    id "com.athaydes.osgi-run" version "1.4.2"
}
```

### Older Gradle versions

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.athaydes.gradle.osgi:osgi-run-core:1.4.2"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.athaydes.osgi-run'
```

## Quick Start

Given a Gradle project whose sub-projects are OSGi bundles, create an OSGi environment
containing the sub-projects' bundles, running it with Apache Felix and the Gogo bundles:

*build.gradle*
```groovy
runOsgi {
  bundles += subprojects
}
```

Or if your OSGi environment consists of the Gradle project itself,
its compile-time dependencies, plus some existing bundle such as the
[Felix implementation](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-config-admin.html) 
of the OSGi Config Admin Service:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.osgi', name: 'org.osgi.enterprise', version: '5.0.0'
    osgiRuntime group: 'org.apache.felix', name: 'org.apache.felix.configadmin', version: '1.8.8'
}

runOsgi {
    // OSGi bundles should not be included in the runtime
    excludedBundles = [ '.*org.osgi.*' ]
    javaArgs = "-Dexample.configFile=${file( 'config-example.properties' ).absolutePath}"
    bundles += project
}
```

From the project's root directory, type:

```
gradle runOsgi
```

This will create and run the OSGi environment during the Gradle build.

Alternatively, you can just create the OSGi environment, then run it later using the run scripts created by osgi-run:

```
gradle createOsgiRuntime
```

This will create an OSGi environment in the output directory, which by default is `generated/osgi`.

To run it:

```
cd generated/osgi
chmod +x run.sh  # may be necessary in Linux/Mac
./run.sh # In Windows, use run.bat
```

Once the framework starts, type ``lb`` (or ``ps``) to see all bundles installed and running.
To see a list of commands available, type ``help``.
Stop the OSGi framework by typing ``exit``, ``stop 0`` (stops the system bundle) or pressing `Ctrl+C`.

Notice that you can include any artifact, such as Maven dependencies, in your bundle environment.

The default OSGi container is Apache Felix, but you can easily use Equinox and Knopflerfish as well.

For complete examples, continue reading the next sections or go straight to the samples in [osgi-run-test](osgi-run-test/).

### Declarative Services Plugin

If you use OSGi Declarative Services, you should have a look at the `osgi-ds` plugin, which is part of the
`osgi-run` core distribution.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.athaydes.osgi-ds'

declarativeServices {
    declarations {
        component( name: 'classTrieMessageBus' ) {
            implementation( 'class': 'com.athaydes.osgi.ds.ClassTrieMessageBus' )
            service {
                provide( 'interface': 'com.athaydes.osgi.messaging.MessageBus' )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, have a look at the [DS Plugin Demo](osgi-run-test/declarative-services-demo).

### IPojo Plugin

If you use [IPojo](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html),
you should definitely check out the [IPojo Plugin](ipojo-plugin), which complements the ``osgi-run`` plugin
to make it really easy to develop and run your OSGi/IPojo projects.

For examples of using IPojo and Gradle, see the test projects:

* [ipojo-example](osgi-run-test/ipojo-example) - annotation-based IPojo project
* [ipojo-xml-example](osgi-run-test/ipojo-xml-example) - XML-configured IPojo project
* [ipojo-dosgi](osgi-run-test/ipojo-dosgi) - Distributed OSGi with IPojo

## Tasks

  * ``createOsgiRuntime``: create the OSGi runtime based on configuration provided (or the defaults).
      This task depends on the ``jar`` task of the project and its sub-projects.
  * ``runOsgi``: starts the OSGi runtime (depends on ``createOsgiRuntime``).

## Configuring osgi-run

`osgi-run` accepts the following configuration:

  * ``runOsgi``: allows configuration of the OSGi runtime.
    It contains the following settable properties (all properties are optional):
    
    * ``configSettings``: String, one of ``['equinox', 'felix', 'knopflerfish', 'none']`` (default ``"felix"``).
        This is used to generate a default config file for the OSGi container selected and affects the
        defaults used for most other properties. **Always make this the first property you declare** otherwise
        it will overwrite other properties with the default values for the container selected.
        Set to ``none`` if you want to provide your own config file.
    * ``outDir``: output directory (default: ``"osgi"``).
        Can be a String (relative to the project ``buildDir``) or a File (used as-is).
    * ``bundles``: Extra resources to include in the OSGi ``bundle`` folder 
        (defaults: in Felix: ``runOsgi.FELIX_GOGO_BUNDLES``, in Equinox: ``[]``).
        Each item can be anything accepted by ``Project.files(Object... paths)``.
    * ``osgiMain``: Main OSGi run-time 
        (default: ``FELIX``, set to ``EQUINOX``, or ``KNOPFLERFISH`` depending on `configSettings`).
        Accepts anything accepted by ``Project.files(Object... paths)``.
    * ``javaArgs``: String with arguments to be passed to the java process (default: ``""``).
    * ``programArgs``: String with arguments to be passed to the main Java class (main args).
    * ``bundlesPath``: String with path where the bundles should be copied to 
      (default for Felix: ``"bundle"``, for Equinox: ``"plugins"``).
    * ``config``: Map of properties that should be added to the container's config file.
        This property is ignored if `configSettings` is set to 'none'.
    * ``wrapInstructions``: instructions for wrapping non-bundles. See the relevant section below.
    * ``excludedBundles``: List of regular expressions to match against bundle file names
        which must not be added to the OSGi runtime.

The default `config` for Felix is:
        
```groovy
'felix.auto.deploy.action'  : 'install,start',
'felix.log.level'           : 1,
'org.osgi.service.http.port': 8080,
'obr.repository.url'        : 'http://felix.apache.org/obr/releases.xml'
```

The default `config` for Equinox is (notice `osgi.bundles` is set dynamically based on the `bundles` property:

```groovy
eclipse.ignoreApp : true,
osgi.noShutdown   : true,
osgi.bundles      : [bundle1-location@start,bundle2-location@start,...]
```

The default `config` for Knopflerfish is (notice `bundle-1` and `fragment-1` are actually derived from
the `bundles` property):

```groovy
-Dorg.knopflerfish.framework.main.verbosity  =  0
-Forg.knopflerfish.framework.debug.resolver  =  false
-Forg.knopflerfish.framework.debug.errors  =  true
-Forg.knopflerfish.framework.debug.classloader  =  false
-Forg.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra  =  
-Forg.knopflerfish.startlevel.use  =  true
-init   
-launch   

-istart $bundle-1
-install $fragment-1
```

> Notice that to use Knopflerfish, you need to add its Maven Repository to your build file.
    
The following constants can be used to provide values for the above properties:
    
* ``FELIX``: the Apache Felix main jar. Can be used to set ``osgiMain``.
* ``FELIX_GOGO_BUNDLES``: the Felix Gogo bundles. Can be used with ``bundles``.
* ``EQUINOX``: The Eclipse Equinox main jar. Can be used to set ``osgiMain``.
* ``KNOPFLERFISH``: The Knopflerfish Framework jar. Can be used to set ``osgiMain``.
* ``IPOJO_BUNDLE``: The IPojo bundle. Can be used with ``bundles``.
* ``IPOJO_ALL_BUNDLES``: The IPojo bundle plus IPojo Arch and command-line support bundles. Can be used with ``bundles``.

Here's an example setting most properties (notice that normally you won't need to set nearly as many):

```groovy
runOsgi {
    configSettings = 'equinox'            // use Equinox's config file instead of Felix's
    osgiMain = 'org.eclipse.osgi:org.eclipse.osgi:3.7.1' // use a specific version of Equinox
    javaArgs = '-DmyProp=someValue'       // pass some args to the Java process
    programArgs = '-console'              // pass some arguments to the Equinox starter
    bundles += allprojects.toList() + IPOJO_BUNDLE // bundles are: this project + subprojects + IPojo
    config += [ 'osgi.clean': true ]      // add properties to the Equinox config
    outDir = 'runtime'                    // the environment will be built at "${project.buildDir}/runtime"
}
```

### Wrapping non-bundles (flat jars)

If any of the artifacts you include in the OSGi environment are not OSGi bundles
(ie. they are flat jars which do not contain OSGi meta-data), they will be automatically
wrapped by `osgi-run` into OSGi bundles which export all of their contents.

This allows you to use any Java artifact whatsoever, so you are not limited to only OSGi bundles.

The actual wrapping is done by [Bnd](http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd).

If you want to provide extra meta-data for ``Bnd`` to improve the wrapping results, you can use
`wrapInstructions` as follows:

```groovy
runOsgi {
    bundles += project

    wrapInstructions {
        // use regex to match file name of dependency
        manifest( "c3p0.*" ) {
            // import everything except the log4j package - should not be needed
            instruction 'Import-Package', '!org.apache.log4j', '*'
            instruction 'Bundle-Description', 'c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for making traditional ' +
                    'JDBC drivers "enterprise-ready" by augmenting them with functionality defined by ' +
                    'the jdbc3 spec and the optional extensions to jdbc2.'
        }
    }
}
```

The example above is used in the [quartz-sample](osgi-run-test/quartz-sample) 
to provide extra meta-data for wrapping the `c3p0` jar, which is required by the `Quartz` bundle.

## Gradle Configurations

`osgi-run` adds the following Gradle configurations to the project:

  * ``osgiMain``: same as the ``runOsgi.osgiMain`` property, but declaring this configuration in a project's
      ``dependencies`` overrides that property. 
      It is preferrable to use that property over this configuration.
  * ``osgiRuntime``: has the same purpose as the ``runOsgi.bundles`` property.
      Both the property and the configuration are applied.
      Notice that properties and configurations, by default, consider all transitive dependencies of the bundles/jars.
      Non-bundles (simple jar) are wrapped into OSGi bundles automatically by default.
      If you do not want any transitive dependency of an artifact to be included in the OSGi runtime, you can do:
      
```groovy
dependencies {
    // all your usual dependencies
    ...
    
    osgiRuntime( "your:dependency:1.0" ) {
        transitive = false // transitive dependencies not included in OSGi runtime
    }
}
```

## Implicitly applied plugins

The ``osgi-run`` plugin applies the following plugins:

### More usage examples

The best way to understand how you can configure your OSGi runtime is through examples.

Let's have a look at some common use-cases:

#### Use your Gradle project itself as a bundle

```groovy
runOsgi {
  bundles += project
}
```

As ``FELIX_GOGO_BUNDLES`` is the default value of ``bundles``, the above is equivalent to:

```groovy
runOsgi {
  bundles = FELIX_GOGO_BUNDLES + project
}
```

If you don't want the Gogo bundles installed, just use:

```groovy
runOsgi {
  bundles = [ project ]
}
```

#### Use Gradle sub-projects as bundles

```groovy
runOsgi {
  bundles += subprojects
}
```

#### Use Maven artifacts as runtime bundles

```groovy
dependencies {
  // add all the Apache Felix Gogo bundles to the OSGi runtime
  osgiRuntime 'org.apache.felix:org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime:0.12.1'
  osgiRuntime 'org.apache.felix:org.apache.felix.gogo.shell:0.10.0'
  osgiRuntime 'org.apache.felix:org.apache.felix.gogo.command:0.14.0'
}
```

Notice that the above configuration is equivalent to setting ``osgiConfig.bundles`` to ``FELIX_GOGO_BUNDLES`` (which is the default).

##### Solving *unresolved constraint* errors

###### Including Apache Commons Logging 1.1.1 into your OSGi environment

As another example, suppose you want to run the  [PDF Box library](http://pdfbox.apache.org) in an OSGi environment.
That seems pretty easy, as PDF Box jars are already OSGi bundles!
So you might expect that it should just work if you declare a dependency to it:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:1.8.6' // won't work
}
```

However, when you do ``gradle clean runOsgi``, you will find out it requires Apache Commons Logging at run-time
(which will be automatically wrapped as a bundle by `run-osgi`), but this jar itself requires other things:

```
(org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Unresolved constraint in bundle org.apache.pdfbox.fontbox [2]: 
  Unable to resolve 2.0: missing requirement [2.0] osgi.wiring.package; 
  (osgi.wiring.package=org.apache.commons.logging) 
  [caused by: Unable to resolve 1.0: missing requirement [1.0] osgi.wiring.package;
  (osgi.wiring.package=javax.servlet)])
```

To understand why `osgi-run` could not figure out we needed not only commons-logging, but also some bundle to
provide `javax.servlet`, let's ask Gradle to show us the dependencies of our module:

```
compile - Compile classpath for source set 'main'.
+--- org.osgi:org.osgi.core:4.3.1
\--- org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:1.8.6
     +--- org.apache.pdfbox:fontbox:1.8.6
     |    \--- commons-logging:commons-logging:1.1.1
     +--- org.apache.pdfbox:jempbox:1.8.6
     \--- commons-logging:commons-logging:1.1.1
```

As you can see, it looks as if the commons-logging dependency had no dependencies at all. So `osgi-run`
has no way of knowing there are other needs for commons-logging to work.

Inspecting the POM file of commons-logging reveals what's going on... it declares several optional dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.12</version>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>logkit</groupId>
  <artifactId>logkit</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>avalon-framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>avalon-framework</artifactId>
  <version>4.1.3</version>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.3</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

So this is one case where we need to add a little meta-data by hand.

But that's easy, knowing that we probably won't be needing servlets or the Avalon Framework and the other Apache
dependencies, we can simply tell `osgi-run` that these packages should not be imported at all:

```groovy
runOsgi {
    bundles += project

    wrapInstructions {
        manifest( /commons-logging.*/ ) {
            instruction 'Import-Package', '!javax.servlet,!org.apache.*,*'
        }
    }
}
```

The wrap instruction tells `run-osgi` that the commons-logging bundle should not import the packages 
`javax.servlet` and `org.apache.*` (notice that you may use wildcards), but should import everything else that is
 required when wrapped into an OSGi bundle. 

A working project demonstrating this can be found in the [Installing non-bundles demo](osgi-run-test/installing-non-bundles)).

###### Using Groovy's SwingBuilder inside an OSGi environment

For yet another example, let's consider a bundle which uses Groovy to create a Swing UI.
Using Groovy's `SwingBuilder`, writing UIs is pretty easy! However, if you try to start your bundle, you will be greeted by
a really horrible error at runtime:

```
... 42 more    (too long to show the rest)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: sun.reflect.ConstructorAccessorImpl
 not found by groovy-all [6]
        at org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.findClassOrResourceByDele
gation(BundleWiringImpl.java:1550)
        at org.apache.felix.framework.BundleWiringImpl.access$400(BundleWiringIm
pl.java:77)
...
```

Nothing is more annoying than these runtime ClassNotFoundException's you get in OSGi, especially when
the offending class is clearly part of the JRE!

For cases like this, there's an easy fix... Just add the package of the class that cannot be found to OSGi's
**extra system packages**:

```groovy
runOsgi {
    config += [ 'org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra': 'sun.reflect' ]
}
```

Done! Now you can use the `SwingBuilder` without any concern.
And you can see an actual working demo in the [IPojo-DOSGi Demo](osgi-run-test/ipojo-dosgi), which includes a
`SwingBuilder`-created UI in bundle `code-runner-ui`.

#### Using Equinox as the OSGi container

Simplest possible Equinox setup:

```groovy
runOsgi {
  configSettings = 'equinox'
  programArgs = '-console'
}
```

Notice that this will only start the Equinox Framework with the console enabled but no bundles deployed.
You can install bundles manually using the Equinox console.

But if you want to **deploy some bundles automatically** (your subprojects, for example) to your OSGi environment,
try something like this:

```groovy
runOsgi {
  configSettings = 'equinox'
  programArgs = '-console'
  bundles = subprojects
}
```

This will deploy and start all your bundles (subprojects) when you run ``gradle runOsgi``.
This is done through the ``configuration/config.ini`` file which is generated automatically by ``osgi-run``.
If you do not wish to use this behavior, just set ``configSettings`` to ``"none"`` and copy your own config file
to ``"${runOsgi.outDir}/<configFileLocation>"``.

#### Using a different version of Felix/Equinox or another OSGi container

If you want to declare exactly which version of Felix or Equinox (or you want to use some other OSGi container) you want
to use, you can set ``runOsgi.osgiMain`` to the artifact coordinates of the container.

##### Using an older/newer version of Apache Felix

```groovy
def felixVersion = '3.2.1' // or some other version

runOsgi {
  osgiMain = "org.apache.felix:org.apache.felix.main:$felixVersion"
}
```

##### Using an older/newer version of Equinox

```groovy
def equinoxVersion = '3.6.0.v20100517'

runOsgi {
  configSettings = 'equinox'
  programArgs = '-console'
  osgiMain = "org.eclipse.osgi:org.eclipse.osgi:$equinoxVersion"
}
```

##### Using another OSGi framework implementation

Just point to a runnable artifact which can start up your framework of choice, Knopflerfish, for example:

```groovy
repositories {
  maven {
    url 'http://www.knopflerfish.org/maven2'
  }
}

runOsgi {
  configSettings = 'none'
  osgiMain = "org.knopflerfish:framework:7.1.2"
  bundles = subprojects // your bundles 
}
```
